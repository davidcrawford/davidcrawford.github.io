# When copying business tactics, check the timestamp

People who love building products spend a lot of time thinking about what makes their favorite products great.  So it's very common for startup founders to look at a successful product, comprehend an important principle underlying it's success, and try to replicate that in their own products.  Great artists steal, after all.

But this leads to a common mistakeâ€“using the tactics of a successful product in the context of a fledgling one.  The greatest features of Facebook, Yelp, and Amazon are *capitalizing* on the success they've already attained, taking advantage of network effects they built with *earlier* growth tactics.
