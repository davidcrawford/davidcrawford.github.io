# No comments

I'm not going to enable comments on this site.  I'm not sure if it's a permanent decision, but I'll probably stick with it for a while.

I have a couple of reasons.  First, there are plenty of discussions about content on the web that *don't* occur in the comments, and the quality of those discussions is much higher.  When you discuss an article on Twitter or Facebook, you're talking to people who know you and your thoughts are much more closely tied to your online identity, so you act more like a civilized person.  And on Twitter, it can still be a public discussion that I can be involved in as the author.

But I also think comments are distracting.  I hope to write things here that are worth mulling over, and the first reaction you have should be your own.  If you finish reading an essay of mine and start reading the comments, then you don't have time to consider what I've said before someone else is telling you what to think about it.  It's much too easy for us to substitute the opinions of others for our own, and removing the comments section is a small stand against that.

So I'll leave comments off.  But I want to know what you think.  Send me a message at <david@getmetrica.com> or [@dacattac](http://twitter.com/dacattac).  I look forward to hearing from you.
